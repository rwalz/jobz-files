My CSUN COMP 484 Project. A web app designed to let users view and list jobs in many types of feilds to help speed up the job search process.




Install XAMPP and place project files in the HTDOCS folder
Run the apache server and then in your browser type http://localhost/jobzhome.html


IMPORTANT: There is no option to create an account or login yet, and the search page does not list jobs properly. but using a console log you can see that jobs are created as objects and stored in an array to be pulled from a search request. The search request just does not display the information yet.
